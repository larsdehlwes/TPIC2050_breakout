# TPIC2050_breakout
Provisory breakout board for the [TPIC2050](https://www.ti.com/product/TPIC2050), a 3-beam laser diode driver and 9-channel motor driver, for DVD and Blu-Ray drives. The circuit follows too good part the Typical Application circuit from [Section 9.2](https://www.ti.com/document-viewer/TPIC2050/datasheet/application_and_implementation#SLIS1675680) of the Datasheet, with the exception that P5V12L (the power-supply for the load driver) is hard-connected to P5V (the power-supply for the 5V driver such as tilt/track/focus).
